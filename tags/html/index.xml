      <description>Premise For my first actual blog post, I have decided to start a series about preprints. Awhile ago, an interesting question was brought up by Shannon Ellis in her wonderful blog post “Let there be preprint citations!” (emphasis is mine):
 Problem #2: Preprints often become peer-reviewed research. How will we keep track?
Solution #2a (if this occurs during while the manuscript is being drafted): It is up to the author(s) to ensure that their manuscript is as up to date as possible upon submission for publication.</description>
