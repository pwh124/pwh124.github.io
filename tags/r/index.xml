      <description>Premise For my first actual blog post, I have decided to start a series about preprints. Awhile ago, an interesting question was brought up by Shannon Ellis in her wonderful blog post “Let there be preprint citations!” (emphasis is mine):
 Problem #2: Preprints often become peer-reviewed research. How will we keep track?
Solution #2a (if this occurs during while the manuscript is being drafted): It is up to the author(s) to ensure that their manuscript is as up to date as possible upon submission for publication.</description>

      <description>Hello! If you haven’t been able to tell by the website already, my name is Paul Hook.
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
You can learn alittle bit more about me here, so I won’t go on and on in the inaugural blog post.
 One of the reasons I was driven to create a website/blog was the blog of one of my former Human Genetics program-mates, Shannon Ellis.</description>
