      <description>This post is the first of a series focusing on tracking preprints on bioRxiv. The motivation behind this and a more detailed explanantion can be found here.
Scraping in R When I began to approach preprint tracking, the mysterious world of &amp;ldquo;HTML scraping&amp;rdquo; seemed like something that would help. Simply, scraping allows you to extract information from the underlying HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents that make up websites.
HTML scraping seemed like a good idea for preprint tracking because: A) It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like there are simple/easy ways to access a bioRxiv database that holds such information (especially for someone with limited experience in this like me) and B) Whether or not the paper is published in a peer-reviewed journal is displayed clearly on each preprint&amp;rsquo;s page (see below on the webpage in red).</description>

      <description>Premise For my first set of blog posts, I have decided to start a series about preprints. Awhile ago, an interesting question was brought up by Shannon Ellis in her wonderful blog post &amp;ldquo;Let there be preprint citations!&amp;quot; (emphasis is mine):
Problem #2: Preprints often become peer-reviewed research. How will we keep track?
Solution #2a (if this occurs during while the manuscript is being drafted): It is up to the author(s) to ensure that their manuscript is as up to date as possible upon submission for publication.</description>

      <description>Hello! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to tell by the website already, my name is Paul Hook.
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am in Dr. Andy McCallion&amp;rsquo;s lab.
You can learn a little more about me here, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go on and on in the inaugural blog post.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Paul Hook. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Winston Timp&amp;rsquo;s lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I received my PhD from the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I did my thesis work in Dr. Andy McCallion&amp;rsquo;s lab. There I focused on trying to elucidate the genetics that underlie Parkinson disease and schizophrenia.</description>
