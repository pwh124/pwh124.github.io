      <description>Hello! If you haven’t been able to tell by the website already, my name is Paul Hook.
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
You can learn alittle bit more about me here, so I won’t go on and on in the inaugural blog post.
 One of the reasons I was driven to create a website/blog was the blog of one of my former Human Genetics program-mates, Shannon Ellis.</description>

      <description>My name is Paul Hook. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am in Dr. Andy McCallion’s lab and I am currently working on trying to elucidate the genetics that underlie Parkinson disease and other complex neurological disorders. I am especially interested in non-coding DNA and gene regulation. I have recently realized I enjoy sifting through big datasets and spending hours trying to make the perfect figures in R.</description>

      <description>Single-cell RNA-seq of dopaminergic neurons Github: https://github.com/pwh124/sc-da-parkinsons
This Gitub repo contains code for analyses and figures associated with Hook, et al., 2018
Website: https://pwh124.github.io/sc-da-parkinsons/
I created this website from the Github repo above using the workflowr package. I wanted to create this website so that my data would be more accessible and reproducible.
Single-cell gene expression R Shiny App
 Github: https://github.com/pwh124/th-expression-shiny
 Website: https://pwh124.shinyapps.io/expressionshiny/ 
  I got the bug to create a Shiny App in an attempt to mirror some of the websites made for various other single-cell RNA-seq projects.</description>
