      <description>tl;dr The area on a bioRxiv page that displays where the paper was published is populated using Javascript when the page is loaded. The R package RSelenium allows for the scraping of that dynamically loaded information, including the published paper’s DOI.
 Where I left off In my ongoing series of blog posts attempting to track the publishing of papers on bioRxiv, I left off with being able to scrape bioRxiv pages in R but failing to be able to extract the information about the published peer-reviewed version of the paper.</description>

      <description>This post is the first of a series focusing on tracking preprints on bioRxiv. The motivation behind this and a more detailed explanantion can be found here.
Scraping in R When I began to approach preprint tracking, the mysterious world of “HTML scraping” seemed like something that would help. Simply, scraping allows you to extract information from the underlying HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents that make up websites.
HTML scraping seemed like a good idea for preprint tracking because: A) It doesn’t seem like there are simple/easy ways to access a bioRxiv database that holds such information (especially for someone with limited experience in this like me) and B) Whether or not the paper is published in a peer-reviewed journal is displayed clearly on each preprint’s page (see below on the webpage in red).</description>

      <title>Keeping track of preprints</title>

      <description>Premise For my first set of blog posts, I have decided to start a series about preprints. Awhile ago, an interesting question was brought up by Shannon Ellis in her wonderful blog post “Let there be preprint citations!” (emphasis is mine):
 Problem #2: Preprints often become peer-reviewed research. How will we keep track?
Solution #2a (if this occurs during while the manuscript is being drafted): It is up to the author(s) to ensure that their manuscript is as up to date as possible upon submission for publication.</description>

      <description>Hello! If you haven’t been able to tell by the website already, my name is Paul Hook.
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am in Dr. Andy McCallion’s lab.
You can learn a little more about me here, so I won’t go on and on in the inaugural blog post.</description>

      <description>My name is Paul Hook. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Human Genetics program in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am in Dr. Andy McCallion’s lab and I am currently working on trying to elucidate the genetics that underlie Parkinson disease and other complex neurological disorders. I am especially interested in non-coding DNA and gene regulation. I have recently realized I enjoy sifting through big datasets and spending hours trying to make the perfect figures in R.</description>
